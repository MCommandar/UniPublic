## Lecture 1
Some Very basic probability

- Model
  - abstract representation of data
- probability model 
  - we normally don’t know the probability so we have to estimate based on the incoming informations

## Lecture 2 (Naive Bayes)
- supervised machine learning algorithms
- Based on the bayes rule, for a given instance X with features x^I^ (I = 1…n)
  - we want $argmaxP(Y=c|X=x^i)$ 
  - We have
